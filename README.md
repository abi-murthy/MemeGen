# MemeGen
Funny Image Generator

This project generates random meme images that can then have text moved to the corresponding
spaces to create a 'meme' as the user desires. Currently, the webpage makes a call to 
an API to obtain the top 100 most popular 'meme' formats, and displays a random one on load. 
Button pushes will randomly pick another image from the API's top 100 list and display that.
